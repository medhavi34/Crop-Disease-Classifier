# Crop-Disease-Classifier
I borrowed the Plant Village dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset/). I solved this multi-classification problem by using FastAI to detect what disease a certain leaf of a plant shows. I later achieved an accuracy of 99+%. I have plans of developing a model that can conduct multi-label and multi-classification on various different images.
